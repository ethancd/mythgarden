# Mythgarden
Mythgarden is a time-loop farming-sim RPG that you can play in your browser. Think Stardew Valley + Groundhog Day, with a quirky vibe and an arcade feel.

## Tech Stack
Mythgarden was built using a Django backend and a React frontend with Typescript.

## Code flow / State machine
- **Initial page load**
  - [mythgarden.ashkie.com][ashkie] -> [urls.py](mythgarden/urls.py) -> [views.home](mythgarden/views.py) -> [action_generator.py](mythgarden/game_logic/action_generator.py) -> [home.html](mythgarden/templates/mythgarden/home.html) -> [app.tsx](mythgarden/static/mythgarden/js/app.tsx)
- **Player requests action**
  - [action.tsx](mythgarden/js/action.tsx) -> [ajax.tsx](mythgarden/js/ajax.tsx) -> [views.action](mythgarden/views.py)
- **Server executes player action**
  - [action_executor.py](mythgarden/game_logic/action_executor.py)
- **Server fires any time-based game events**
  - [event_operator.py](mythgarden/game_logic/event_operator.py)
- **Server updates state in database**
- **New state is returned to browser**
  - [views.action](mythgarden/views.py)

## Deployment

### Production
The production app is deployed to Fly.io at `django-mythgarden-fly`. Deployments happen automatically when changes are merged to the `main` or `master` branch via GitHub Actions.

### Staging / PR Previews
A staging environment (`django-mythgarden-staging`) is available for preview deployments. When you open or update a pull request, GitHub Actions will automatically deploy the PR changes to the staging server and post a comment with the staging URL.

**Note:** The staging environment is shared across all PRs, so only the most recently updated PR will be deployed to staging at any given time.

#### First-time Setup
Before the staging deployment workflow can run, you need to:

1. Create the staging app on Fly.io:
   ```bash
   flyctl apps create django-mythgarden-staging
   ```

2. Ensure the `FLY_API_TOKEN` secret is set in your GitHub repository settings (should already be configured for production deployments).

3. Deploy the staging app for the first time:
   ```bash
   flyctl deploy --config fly.staging.toml
   ```
